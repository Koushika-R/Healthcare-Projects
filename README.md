# Healthcare Projects
Basic data science projects based on the healthcare domain. The datasets used are obtained from Kaggle.
TASK 1_Healthcare Dataset - It is a synthetic dataset. Performed basic EDA, visualization, encoding, and applied a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset for three-class classification.
Task 2_Pima Indians Diabetes Database - The workflow began with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, and addressing skewness through appropriate transformations to improve model performance. Three classification models— Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree—were developed and evaluated.
